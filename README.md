Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 for secure user access, encrypt sensitive data with HTTPS, and securely store passwords using hashing. (passport in Nodejs)

Cost Estimation - Time and Space: Employ profiling tools to analyze system complexity, optimize algorithms and data structures, and conduct regular performance testing.

Handling System Failure Cases: Implement redundancy and automated recovery mechanisms, regularly back up user and system data, and use failover systems for critical components.

Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOPS): Choose a robust OOPS language like Java or Python, apply principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for modular code.(Exception Handling java)

Trade-offs in the System: Document design decisions and trade-offs, balance performance, scalability, and maintainability, and regularly reassess decisions based on system evolution.

System Monitoring: Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus, use logging for real-time issue identification, and set up alerts for critical system parameters.(clerk and firebase)

Caching: Implement caching for frequently accessed data using a caching library like Redis, monitor cache hits and misses, and utilize appropriate eviction policies for optimal resource utilization. (Express Sessions)
 
Error and Exception Handling: Develop a consistent error handling framework, provide descriptive error messages for debugging, and regularly review and update error-handling strategies based on usage patterns.
